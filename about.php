  <h3>Physics being known as diffiult subject with less interest among students, I focus to make the subject more interesting by correlating the subjects with real life example. <br>My style of imparting eduction mainly one to one focus and putting more efforts on students. Physics being one of the most evolving subjects which require constant upgradation and lots of career opportunity in years ahead. <br>I am very keen to make younger generation to take the subject as interesting and career orieted subject.
